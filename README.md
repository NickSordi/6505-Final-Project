# DATA 6505: Data Munging in Python FINAL PROJECT 
## Fall 2023
__This is the README.md for the GridRevolution Project.__

# PROJECT - Analysis of EIA data

## SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset for our project was sourced from the US Energy Information Administration API (see: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). 

## Expected Results Presentation:

How has the Untied States electricity generated changed over time. In recent years we have seen many things going electric. What will that look like for US infrastructure? We wanted to better understand where our power comes from now and where it will come from in the future. 



# Key research areas for descriptive analysis:

US electricity generation:

How much power does the US generate per year? How has it changed in the past? Can we predict where power generation will go in the future?

Energy generation by State and Sector:

What states produce the most electricity?

Energy sources:

What types of energy does the US use to generate power and how has it changed over the past 20 year?

Seasonal Energy Consumption:

On average, which months have the highest energy consumption in each state?
How does seasonality affect the demand for electricity?
