# DATA 6505: Data Munging in Python FINAL PROJECT 
## Fall 2023
__This is the README.md for the GridRevolution Project.__

# PROJECT - Analysis of EIA data

## SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset for our project was sourced from the US Energy Information Administration API (see: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). 

## Expected Results Presentation:

EDA of the us power generation
What is the growth rate of the energy consumption from 1950- present?
At what rate has renewable energy been growing by state? 
Change in energy used for transportation?

<ins>Follow up questions as analysis goes on:<ins>

If coal has been declining has production changed as well?


# Key research areas for descriptive analysis:

US power generation:

how much power does the US gnerg generation per year? How has it changes in the past?

Energy generation by State and Sector:

What does the total energy porduction for the US look like over time. What state produce the most energy?

Energy sources:

What types of energy does the US use to generate power? 

Renewable Energy Growth by State:

At what rate has renewable energy consumption been growing in each state?
Are there specific policies or initiatives that correlate with higher rates of renewable energy adoption?

Seasonal Energy Consumption:

On average, which months have the highest energy consumption in each state?
How does seasonality affect the demand for energy, and does it coincide with patterns in EV charging?
