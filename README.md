# DATA 6505: Data Munging in Python FINAL PROJECT 
## Fall 2023
__This is the README.md for the GridRevolution Project.__

# PROJECT - Analysis of EIA data

## SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset for our project was sourced from the US Energy Information Administration API (see: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). 

## Expected Results Presentation:

EDA of the us power generation
What is the growth rate of the energy consumption from 1950- present?
At what rate has renewable energy been growing by state? 
Change in energy used for transportation?

<ins>Follow up questions as analysis goes on:<ins>

If coal has been declining has production changed as well?


# Key research areas for descriptive analysis:

Energy Consumption by State and Sector:

What states consume the most energy, and how is energy consumption distributed among residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors?

Total Energy Costs:

Which states have experienced the highest growth in total energy costs over the past decade, and what factors contribute to this increase?

Renewable Energy Growth by State:

At what rate has renewable energy consumption been growing in each state?
Are there specific policies or initiatives that correlate with higher rates of renewable energy adoption?

Seasonal Energy Consumption:

On average, which months have the highest energy consumption in each state?
How does seasonality affect the demand for energy, and does it coincide with patterns in EV charging?

Historical Energy Consumption Growth:

What is the overall growth rate of energy consumption in the United States from 1950 to the present?
Are there significant events or trends that correlate with periods of accelerated or reduced energy consumption growth?

Peak Energy Consumption Year:

In which year did the United States consume the most energy, and what factors contributed to this peak?
Conversely, in which year did the country consume the least energy, and what circumstances led to this decrease?
