# PROJECT - Analysis of EIA data

# SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset for our project was sourced from the US Energy Information Administration API (see: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). The dataset gives us insights into the emergency service (EMS) calls made in the city of San Francisco. It gives us the most recent 
information on various parameters like different types of EMS calls received, location, time taken by the department to respond from the time it was reported until the closure time, personnel information etc. The data was downloaded on November 15, 2019.
